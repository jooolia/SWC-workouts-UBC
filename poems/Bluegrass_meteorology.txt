Bluegrass Meteorology by Alison Smith 

When the sky blackens I get that old feeling 
in my legs: banjo plucking, quick chicken scratching under 
loose skin, quiver of daises popping up from clay. 
It takes me back to where I wasn’t: aunts half asleep 
behind the kitchen, the sky fattening like a damp songbook.
Revelry strains the house as the grandparents strum 
getaway  getaway clapboard dreams of Jamboree glory. 
Their children grew up as radio towers: innards wired 
to weather and song. Through them, I learned to feel all the oldies.

The grandparents are gone now, save for bluegrass weather— 
a grey polyester sky with periwinkle lapels, the way it feels when 
fiddles lift on frayed Jack Pines and rain is fixing to jump 
out of silence into a lickety-split tempo. 
When that weather comes, you’ve got to cry, cry harder
or pick up your instrument and learn to play what you feel. 
There is no heaven. The grandparents are over us 
like snow, dirt-balling cloud, or under us like water churned by wind. 
They return in spells of bad weather, sobered by the elements, as if 
they’d always meant to sing us over yonder.
